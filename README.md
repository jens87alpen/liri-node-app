# Liri-Node-App

# Description
In this project I created LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# Terminal
LIRI will display Barack Obama's latest tweets.
